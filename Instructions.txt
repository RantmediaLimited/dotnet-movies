You will have 90 minutes to complete as many items as possible.
You are not necessarily expected to finish all features.  If you do finish, you can then improve your app in any way you like.
We would like to see you work as you usually would - please feel free to use any reference material, notes and resources you would like (Stack Overflow, Google searches etc).
We are more interested in your approach to code than the design of the app - very basic UI is fine.  Code quality and structure is particularly important - an incomplete solution with good code will be better received than a complete but poorly structured response. 

1. Fix MovieJsonStoreTests by implementing MovieJsonStore using Linq.

2. MovieController is too tightly coupled to Json.  Decouple it using IMovie and IMovieStore

3. MoviesController action methods are taking too long.  What can be done?

4. In Movies.Web\Controllers\Movies\Index.cshtml
	Remove "var movie" and show a row for each movie
	Make "Details" link, navigate to the specific movie's details

5. Details.cshtml isn't showing the Overview text.  Fix this.

6. MoviesController should use MovieService instead of directly calling the store

7. Make MoviesService.EmailMovieDetailsAsync() call MovieEmailer.EmailMovieDetailsAsync()

8. Although MovieEmailer is pretending to email, it is still inefficient.  Why?

9. Make MovieController.EmailMovieDetails call MovieService.EmailMovieDetailsAsync() and show the caller the details page again

10. The user's email address is getting stored in the browser history.  How can this be fixed?

11. The root of the website should invoke MoviesController.Index() and we would like movie details to be accessible at /movie/the-movie-id.  Please update the routing.
